     <p>Dear XXX_CUSTFIRSTNAME,</p>

    <p>Re: Construction Quality Assurance Assessment Report (Stage 1) at <strong>XXX_PROPADDRESS1, XXX_PROPCITY.</strong></p>

    <p>Congratulations on choosing Archicentre Australia to assess this property. We are pleased to provide your Archicentre Australia Construction Quality Assurance Report which contains information on the visual defects and other important strategic advice. </p>

    <p>Please read the full Report including the related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>

    <p>Click <a href="XXX_LINKREPORT">Here</a> to receive your report.</p>

    <p>Click <a href="https://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/report_downloads/">Here</a> to receive related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>

    <p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most important that you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

    <p>This letter also contains important information. Please take the time to read it. </p>

    <p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact the architect name. For all other queries, please contact this office and our customer service staff will be pleased to assist. </p>

    <p><strong>The Report: Stage 1 - Fix/Fitout</strong></p>

    <p>The Report will have noted a number of items that require attention – then assisting you with completion on site. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access. If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the assessment, it is important that you contact the architect and arrange for a second assessment when access to restricted areas has been made available. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-assessment depending on the time taken. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is your responsibility. </li>
      <li>We suggest that you seek ongoing assistance from the assessing architect to ensure that the  work is carried out in a satisfactory manner. </li>
      <li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact the Architect XXX_ARCHITECTNAME on XXX_ARCHITECTPHONE.</p>

    <p>Regards</p>
