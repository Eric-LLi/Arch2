		<p>Dear XXX_CUSTFIRSTNAME,</p>

		<p>Re: Residential Timber Pest Inspection Report at <strong>XXX_PROPADDRESS1, XXX_PROPCITY</strong>.</p>

		<p>Please find attached completed Residential Timber Pest Inspection Report as requested.</p>

		<p>Please read the full Report including the related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>

		<p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most important that you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

		<p>This letter also contains important information. Please take the time to read it.</p>

		<p><strong>The Report</strong></p>

		<p>The Report will have noted a number of items that require repair or maintenance. If you are considering purchasing the property, we trust the report may assist you in making allowance in your budget for items that require expenditure or; negotiating a better purchase price. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the inspection, it is important that you contact the pest inspector and arrange for a second assessment when access to restricted areas has been made available. </strong></p>

		<p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-inspection depending on the time taken. Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is your responsibility. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property. </li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Balconies and Decks</strong></p>

		<p>We recommend annual assessments of external timber/concrete decks &amp; balconies be undertaken to verify their soundness. If in doubt, advice from a structural engineer or building surveyor is essential. </p>

		<p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact the XXX_ARCHITECTNAME on XXX_ARCHITECTPHONE. For all other queries, please contact this office and our customer service staff will be pleased to assist.</p>

		<p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this inspection and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing services.</p>

		<p>Regards</p>
