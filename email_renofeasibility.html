	  <p>Dear XXX_CUSTFIRSTNAME,</p>

    <p>Re: Residential Renovation Feasibility Report at <strong>XXX_PROPADDRESS1, XXX_PROPCITY</strong>.</p>

	  <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to assist you with the renovation of your home. Please find attached our architect&rsquo;s sketch drawings/s illustrating a proposed strategy. At this stage the effort will be to simply establish an overall building/siting plan based upon your brief and budgetary conversation. Broad matters of construction relative to the site and relevant regulatory controls can be given statement.</p>

	  <p>On the matter of project cost advice, please refer to the report attached to the drawings.</p>

    <p>Click <a href="XXX_LINKREPORT">Here</a> to receive your sketch drawings and report.</p>

    <p>In the current market it would be prudent to expect the construction cost to be closer to the upper end of the above range. It would also be wise to allow a 5-10% contingency sum to meet any unforeseen expenses.</p>

	  <p>Should you decide to proceed with the project our architect XXX_ARCHITECTNAME on XXX_ARCHITECTPHONE who will be happy to prepare a detailed fee proposal for your consideration. We strongly recommend that you consider engaging them to provide further service given their expertise and familiarity with the project.</p>

	 <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing services.</p>

	 <p>Regards</p>
