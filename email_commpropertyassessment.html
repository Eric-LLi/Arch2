  		<p>Please read the full Reports including the related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>

		<p>Click <a href="https://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/report_downloads/">Here</a> to receive related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>
				  
		<p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most 
			important that you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

		<p>This letter also contains important information. Please take the time to read it.</p>
				  
		<p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact the architect whose 
			name appears on the report. For all other queries, please contact this office and our customer service staff 
			will be pleased to assist.</p> 
		
		<p><strong>The Report</strong></p>
		
		<p>The Assessment Report will have noted a number of items that require repair or maintenance. If you are considering purchasing
		the property, we trust the report may assist you in making allowance in your budget for items that require expenditure or;
		negotiating a better purchase price.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Reiterating the advice in the Archicentre Australia Terms and Conditions of the assessment and/or inspection we recommend budgeting a further 5% of the value of the property over the first five years of ownership to provide a &quot;safety net&quot; against unexpected costs that may arise and that this be taken into account when establishing a purchase price. </li>

			<li>We recommend that for items noted as serious faults, specialist advice be obtained prior to the purchase, to clearly identify realistic rectification costs.</li>

			<li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment and/or inspection but each report is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the assessment/inspection, it is important that you contact the architect and/or inspector and arrange for a second assessment and/or inspection when access to restricted areas has been made available.</p>
		
		<p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-assessment depending on the time taken. Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is the owner&rsquo;s responsibility. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>If you are planning repairs and maintenance the Professional and Trade Guide in the Property Assessment Report is intended to assist you in contacting the appropriate tradesperson to rectify or report in more detail on defects noted or suspected by the assessing Architect and/or Pest inspector. </li>

			<li>We suggest that you seek ongoing assistance from the assessing architect to ensure that the best quotes are obtained and that the work is carried out in a satisfactory manner.</li>

			<li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Possible future cracking</strong></p>
		
		<p>It is important to note that during prolonged periods of drought, the foundation material around buildings can become dry and shrink so that cracks can literally open up overnight at any future time. <u>Do not panic.</u> Refer to the Property Maintenance Guide for preventative action or remedial action should future cracks develop. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Balconies and Decks</strong></p>
		
		<p>We recommend annual assessments of external timber/concrete decks &amp; balconies be undertaken to verify their soundness. If in doubt, advice from a structural engineer or building surveyor is essential. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Renovation Options</strong></p>
		
		<p>In the event that you do purchase the property you may be interested in Archicentre Australia's Renovation Sketch Design Feasibility service, which are typically one of: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Renovation when internal alterations are considered; </li>

			<li>Renovation to ground floor additions &amp; alterations; </li>

			<li>Renovation to ground and first floor additions and alterations. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Whilst you may not be considering a full renovation for some time, a &quot;Master Plan&quot; can be very useful in a variety of ways. In particular, it can help to avoid the expense of short-term improvements that prove unsuitable in the long term, for example, upgrading a bathroom that's in the ideal location for a future stair, or building a new deck where a future family room would be best. </p>
		
		<p>We also offer a Home Design Consultation to assist clients in selecting the most appropriate direction for their home renovations or redevelopment. </p>
  
		<p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this assessment and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing services.</p>
