    <p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property.<strong>  </strong>It is most important that you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

    <p>This letter also contains important information. Please take the time to read it. </p>

    <p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact the architect whose name appears on the report. For all other queries, please contact this office and we will be pleased to assist. </p>

    <p><strong>The Report</strong></p>

    <p>The Report has been prepared as a visual assessment. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.  </li>

      <li>Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is your responsibility. </li>

      <li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed by the vendor, prior to the sale of the property. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing services. </p>
